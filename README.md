# Apple Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains a deep learning model that predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks â€” a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting.

## Overview

Financial markets are inherently noisy and non-linear, making them a challenging domain for prediction. In this project, we harness the temporal learning capabilities of LSTM networks to model the historical trends of AAPL stock and predict future closing prices.
